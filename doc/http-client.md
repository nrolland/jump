http-client
===========

*If this is your first time reading a Jump tutorial, consider reading the [Jump
tutorial tips](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/jump/blob/master/TIPS.md).*

We'll be using the [http-client](https://www.stackage.org/package/http-client)
library as the base for making HTTP requests.  http-client itself is a
minimalistic package with a relatively low-level API and no support for TLS
(HTTPS). There are add-on packages which provide additional functionality,
e.g.:

* [http-client-tls](https://www.stackage.org/package/http-client-tls) provides TLS support via the Haskell-native tls package
* [http-conduit](https://www.stackage.org/package/http-conduit) allows for streaming request and responses using conduit

In this tutorial, we'll be using these packages together as one library for
making HTTP client requests. We'll start by focusing on the high-level
`Network.HTTP.Simple` API, and then expose some of the details of the
lower-level APIs.

## Concepts

This library makes good use of the `OverloadedStrings` language extension for
converting string literals into `Request`s, `ByteString`s, and case-insensitive
`ByteString`s (for header names). It's strongly recommended to use this library
with this language extension enabled.

## Caveats

There are a few important caveats to mention about this library:

* By default, any non-2XX status code response results in a runtime exception.
  See the examples of `setRequestIgnoreStatus` below for more information
* By default, http-client will respect the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`
  environment variables. See the proxy examples below for information on how to
  bypass this.

## Kick the tires

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-conduit
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    response <- httpLBS "http://httpbin.org/get"

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    L8.putStrLn $ getResponseBody response
```

`httpLBS` makes a request to the given URL and captures the response body as a
lazy `ByteString`. Note that, even though this is a lazy `ByteString`, it is
read fully into memory when making the request. It only returns a lazy
`ByteString` for better memory usage. (See streaming below for more information.)

Once we have our response value, we can use getter functions to look at various
details (status code, headers, and the body).

## Receiving JSON

We can also leverage aeson to receive a JSON message.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-conduit --package yaml
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Data.Aeson            (Value)
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as S8
import qualified Data.Yaml             as Yaml
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    response <- httpJSON "http://httpbin.org/get"

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    S8.putStrLn $ Yaml.encode (getResponseBody response :: Value)
```

The main change is that we used `httpJSON` in place of `httpLBS`. This function
will return any instance of `FromJSON`, and perform all necessary parsing and
conversion. If there are any problems, it will throw a runtime exception (use
`httpJSONEither` to avoid the runtime exception and get an `Either`).

Since the return value can be any `FromJSON` instance, we need to somehow
constrain the value returned. In this case, we used an explicit `:: Value`
signature, but usually you'll do the constraining by using a custom data type.

For fun, this example prints out the JSON body in YAML format.

## Request methods and parseRequest

You can specify the request method at the beginning of your URL:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit --package yaml
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Data.Aeson            (Value)
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as S8
import qualified Data.Yaml             as Yaml
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    response <- httpJSON "POST http://httpbin.org/post"

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    S8.putStrLn $ Yaml.encode (getResponseBody response :: Value)
```

What's actually happening is that the `IsString` instance for `Request` is
being leveraged to parse the string literal to a `Request`. But you can also be
more explicit about it with `parseRequest`:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit --package yaml
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Data.Aeson            (Value)
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as S8
import qualified Data.Yaml             as Yaml
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    request <- parseRequest "POST http://httpbin.org/post"
    response <- httpJSON request

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    S8.putStrLn $ Yaml.encode (getResponseBody response :: Value)
```

`parseRequest` is more explicit about exceptions, whereas the string literal
approach can result in unexpected runtime exceptions if you have a typo in your
code. Generally, `parseRequest` should be your choice when parsing URLs
generated at runtime.

CAUTION: If you provide an invalid URL as a string literal, it will manifest as
a runtime exception when forcing the pure `Request` value, e.g.:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-conduit
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    response <- httpLBS "BAD URL"
    print response
```

generates:

```
foo.hs: InvalidUrlException "BAD URL" "Invalid URL"
```

## Request building

There's a lot more to a request than just the request method. These can be
modified with various request setter functions:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit --package yaml
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Data.Aeson            (Value)
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as S8
import qualified Data.Yaml             as Yaml
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    request' <- parseRequest "POST http://httpbin.org/post"
    let request
            = setRequestMethod "PUT"
            $ setRequestPath "/put"
            $ setRequestQueryString [("hello", Just "world")]
            $ setRequestBodyLBS "This is my request body"
            $ setRequestSecure True
            $ setRequestPort 443
            $ request'
    response <- httpJSON request

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    S8.putStrLn $ Yaml.encode (getResponseBody response :: Value)
```

Exercise for reader: rewrite the code above to not use `parseRequest`.

And in fact, if you want, you can build up a request entirely programmatically,
without any URL parsing:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit --package yaml
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Data.Aeson            (Value)
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as S8
import qualified Data.Yaml             as Yaml
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let request
            = setRequestPath "/get"
            $ setRequestHost "httpbin.org"
            $ defaultRequest
    response <- httpJSON request

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    S8.putStrLn $ Yaml.encode (getResponseBody response :: Value)
```

## Request bodies

Like the response body, there are multiple helper functions for dealing with
different request body formats. These include JSON:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit --package yaml
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Data.Aeson
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as S8
import qualified Data.Yaml             as Yaml
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

data Person = Person String Int
instance ToJSON Person where
    toJSON (Person name age) = object
        [ "name" .= name
        , "age"  .= age
        ]

people :: [Person]
people = [Person "Alice" 30, Person "Bob" 35, Person "Charlie" 40]

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let request = setRequestBodyJSON people $ "POST https://httpbin.org/post"
    response <- httpJSON request

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    S8.putStrLn $ Yaml.encode (getResponseBody response :: Value)
```

Or data from a file:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit --package yaml
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Data.Aeson
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as S8
import qualified Data.Yaml             as Yaml
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

data Person = Person String Int
instance ToJSON Person where
    toJSON (Person name age) = object
        [ "name" .= name
        , "age"  .= age
        ]

people :: [Person]
people = [Person "Alice" 30, Person "Bob" 35, Person "Charlie" 40]

main :: IO ()
main = do
    Yaml.encodeFile "people.yaml" people

    let request = setRequestBodyFile "people.yaml"
                $ setRequestHeader "Content-Type" ["application/x-yaml"]
                $ "PUT https://httpbin.org/put"
    response <- httpJSON request

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    S8.putStrLn $ Yaml.encode (getResponseBody response :: Value)
```

## Non-2XX responses

By default, every request that generates a non-2XX response will generate a
runtime exception. If instead you would like to deal with these responses
directly, you can change that behavior:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit --package yaml
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let request = setRequestIgnoreStatus "PUT https://httpbin.org/delete"
    response <- httpLBS request

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    L8.putStrLn $ getResponseBody response
```

NOTE: The decision to turn non-2XX responses into exceptions is one of the most
controversial decisions in this library, with strong arguments on each side. At
this point, the behavior is well established and won't be changing in the
future.

## Exceptions

There are other potential exceptions that may be thrown by this library, such
as due to failed connections. To catch these, you should catch the
`HttpException` exception type.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-conduit
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Control.Exception          (try)
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    eresponse <- try $ httpLBS "http://does-not-exist"

    case eresponse of
        Left e -> print (e :: HttpException)
        Right response -> L8.putStrLn $ getResponseBody response
```

## Streaming

Sometimes you will want to avoid reading the entire response body into memory
at once. For these cases, a streaming data approach is useful.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Control.Monad.IO.Class (liftIO)
import qualified Data.ByteString        as S
import qualified Data.Conduit.List      as CL
import           Network.HTTP.Simple
import           System.IO              (stdout)

main :: IO ()
main = httpSink "http://httpbin.org/get" $ \response -> do
    liftIO $ putStrLn
           $ "The status code was: "
          ++ show (getResponseStatusCode response)

    CL.mapM_ (S.hPut stdout)
```

## Override proxy

By default, requests will use any proxy server specified with the `http_proxy`
or `https_proxy` environment variables. This can be overridden:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit --package yaml
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let request = setRequestProxy (Just (Proxy "127.0.0.1" 3128))
                $ "https://httpbin.org/get"
    response <- httpLBS request

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    L8.putStrLn $ getResponseBody response
```

## Connection Manager

All HTTP requests are made via a `Manager`. A `Manager` handles the details of
creating connections to servers. It handles things like reusing connections (to
avoid high TCP overhead when making multiple requests to the same host). It
also allows you to configure various settings, most important how to make
secure connections (HTTPS).

For ease of use and to ensure maximum connection sharing in an application, the
`Network.HTTP.Simple` module uses a shared global connection `Manager` by
default. If desired, you can create your own `Manager` and override that
global:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit --package yaml
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Client        (defaultManagerSettings, newManager)
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager defaultManagerSettings

    let request = setRequestManager manager "http://httpbin.org/get"
    response <- httpLBS request

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    L8.putStrLn $ getResponseBody response
```

Exercises:

1. Modify the above to make an HTTPS connection instead. What happens?
2. Fix the error generated by the previous step by using
   `Network.HTTP.Client.TLS.tlsManagerSettings`

You can also override the global manager if, for example, you want to tweak
some settings:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc
   --package http-conduit --package yaml
 -}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Client
import           Network.HTTP.Client.TLS
import           Network.HTTP.Simple

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager $ managerSetProxy noProxy tlsManagerSettings
    setGlobalManager manager

    let request = "http://httpbin.org/get"
    response <- httpLBS request

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (getResponseStatusCode response)
    print $ getResponseHeader "Content-Type" response
    L8.putStrLn $ getResponseBody response

For our purposes, you should use
`tlsManagerSettings` to ensure you have full HTTP and HTTPS support (as all
examples below do).
```

## Lower level API

The above docs all cover the `Network.HTTP.Simple` API. However, there is a
lower-level API available in `Network.HTTP.Client`, which may be advantageous
in some cases. The rest of this tutorial provides some examples of this
lower-level API.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-client-tls
import Network.HTTP.Client
import Network.HTTP.Client.TLS   (tlsManagerSettings)
import Network.HTTP.Types.Status (statusCode)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager tlsManagerSettings

    request <- parseUrl "http://httpbin.org/get"
    response <- httpLbs request manager

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
               show (statusCode $ responseStatus response)
    print $ responseBody response
```

We're using `newManager tlsManagerSettings` to get a new `Manager`, `parseUrl`
to parse a textual URL into a `Request`, and then making the request with
`httpLbs`. Once we have our `Response`, we can use standard accessors to
inspect its fields. 

## Receiving JSON

It's also straightforward to compose this streaming with aeson to parse JSON:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-conduit --package aeson
import           Data.Aeson.Parser           (json)
import           Data.Conduit                (($$))
import           Data.Conduit.Attoparsec     (sinkParser)
import           Network.HTTP.Client
import           Network.HTTP.Client.Conduit (bodyReaderSource)
import           Network.HTTP.Client.TLS     (tlsManagerSettings)
import           Network.HTTP.Types.Status   (statusCode)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager tlsManagerSettings

    request <- parseUrl "http://httpbin.org/get"

    withResponse request manager $ \response -> do
        putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
                   show (statusCode $ responseStatus response)

        value <- bodyReaderSource (responseBody response)
              $$ sinkParser json
        print value
```

## Sending JSON

Sending JSON can be done with modifying the request method and body:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-client-tls --package aeson
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Data.Aeson                 (encode, object, (.=))
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Client
import           Network.HTTP.Client.TLS
import           Network.HTTP.Types.Status  (statusCode)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager tlsManagerSettings

    -- Create the request
    let requestObject = object
            [ "name" .= ("Alice" :: String)
            , "age"  .= (35 :: Int)
            ]
    initialRequest <- parseUrl "http://httpbin.org/post"
    let request = initialRequest
            { method = "POST"
            , requestBody = RequestBodyLBS $ encode requestObject
            , requestHeaders =
                [ ("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=utf-8")
                ]
            }

    response <- httpLbs request manager
    putStrLn $ "The status code was: "
            ++ show (statusCode $ responseStatus response)
    L8.putStrLn $ responseBody response
```

Another common request body format is URL encoded bodies. The `urlEncodedBody`
function is a convenient function for doing this. Note that it automatically
sets the request method to `POST`, which we can override if desired:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-client-tls
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Client
import           Network.HTTP.Client.TLS
import           Network.HTTP.Types.Status  (statusCode)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager tlsManagerSettings

    initialRequest <- parseUrl "http://httpbin.org/put"
    let pairs =
            [ ("name", "Alice")
            , ("age", "35")
            ]
        request = (urlEncodedBody pairs initialRequest)
            { method = "PUT"
            }

    response <- httpLbs request manager
    putStrLn $ "The status code was: "
            ++ show (statusCode $ responseStatus response)
    L8.putStrLn $ responseBody response
```

## Non-2XX responses

By default, a non-2XX response (such as a 404 not found) will generate a
runtime exception. You can change this behavior with the `checkStatus` setting.
The code below will never throw exceptions based on the status code.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-client-tls
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Client
import           Network.HTTP.Client.TLS
import           Network.HTTP.Types.Status  (statusCode)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager tlsManagerSettings

    -- Make a GET request to a POST-expecting endpoint, which will generate a
    -- 405 status code
    let request = "http://httpbin.org/post"
            { checkStatus = \_ _ _ -> Nothing
            }

    response <- httpLbs request manager
    putStrLn $ "The status code was: "
            ++ show (statusCode $ responseStatus response)
    L8.putStrLn $ responseBody response
```

## Proxy settings

By default, http-client will respect the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`
environment variables. You can modify this when creating your `Manager`:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-client-tls
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Client
import           Network.HTTP.Client.TLS
import           Network.HTTP.Types.Status  (statusCode)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager $ managerSetProxy noProxy tlsManagerSettings

    response <- httpLbs "http://httpbin.org/get" manager

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: "
            ++ show (statusCode $ responseStatus response)
    L8.putStrLn $ responseBody response
```

You can also modify the proxy settings per-request:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-client-tls
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as L8
import           Network.HTTP.Client
import           Network.HTTP.Client.TLS
import           Network.HTTP.Types.Status  (statusCode)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager tlsManagerSettings

    let request = "http://httpbin.org/get"
            { proxy = Just $ Proxy "127.0.0.1" 3128
            }
    response <- httpLbs request manager

    putStrLn $ "The status code was: "
            ++ show (statusCode $ responseStatus response)
    L8.putStrLn $ responseBody response
```

If you set both the manager and request proxy overrides, the manager setting

## Sharing the Manager

There is a small cost to initializing a `Manager`. More importantly, each
`Manager` maintains its own pool of connections. It is highly advisable to
share your `Manager` value throughout your application. This will decrease TCP
handshake overhead, and make it less likely that you will make too many
connections to a single server at once.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-client-tls --package async
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Control.Concurrent.Async  (Concurrently (..))
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8     as S8
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy      as L
import           Data.Foldable             (sequenceA_)
import qualified Data.Text                 as T
import           Data.Text.Encoding        (encodeUtf8)
import           Network.HTTP.Client
import           Network.HTTP.Client.TLS
import           Network.HTTP.Types.Status (statusCode)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager tlsManagerSettings

    runConcurrently $ sequenceA_ $ replicate 16
                    $ Concurrently $ doSomething manager

doSomething :: Manager -> IO ()
doSomething manager = do
    let request = "http://httpbin.org/get"

    response <- httpLbs request manager

    let msg = encodeUtf8 $ T.pack $ concat
            [ "Got a message with status code "
            , show $ statusCode $ responseStatus response
            , " with response body length "
            , show $ L.length $ responseBody response
            , "\n"
            ]

    -- Using bytestring-based output to avoid interleaving of string-based
    -- output
    S8.putStr msg
```

## Streaming

Beneath the conduit-based streaming API you've already seen, there is a
lower-level streaming API:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-5.13 runghc --package http-client-tls
import qualified Data.ByteString           as S
import           Network.HTTP.Client
import           Network.HTTP.Client.TLS   (tlsManagerSettings)
import           Network.HTTP.Types.Status (statusCode)
import           System.IO                 (stdout)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    manager <- newManager tlsManagerSettings

    request <- parseUrl "http://httpbin.org/get"

    withResponse request manager $ \response -> do
        putStrLn $ "The status code was: " ++
                   show (statusCode $ responseStatus response)

        let loop = do
                bs <- brRead $ responseBody response
                if S.null bs
                    then putStrLn "\nFinished response body"
                    else do
                        S.hPut stdout bs
                        loop
        loop
```
